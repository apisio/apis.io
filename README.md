2. Install scalingo command line tool [link](http://cli.scalingo.com/)
3. Login in your scalingo account with the CLI `scalingo login`
4. Create a new app `scalingo create NAME_OF_MY_APP`
This will create a new app on Scalingo and add a new remote on your git repo.
5. Meteor needs a MongoDB instance, add it to your scalingo app `scalingo -a NAME_OF_MY_APP addons-add scalingo-mongodb free`
6. Deploy your app with `git push scalingo master`, your app should now be available at `NAME_OF_MY_APP.scalingo.com`

## Understanding Collections
This project uses 3 Meteor collections:
+ APIFiles, to store all info from an `apis.json` file
+ APIs, to store individual APIs described in an APIFile
+ Maintainers, to store info about Maintainers

## APIs.io's API
APIs.io has it own API and the documentation could be found [here](http://apis.io/apiDoc) this let you search for APIs, submit a new APIs.json file and get info about maintainers.

The API is monitored using [3scale](http://3scale.net) API management platform, you are free to use another solution to monitor activity.

Code for the API could be found under `/server/api`
